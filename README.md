A style sheet for beamer

There isn't too much complicated. All should be pretty self-explanatory.

Colour Themes:
+ Rexie = dark blue title page, dark blue font on a light grey background
+ Akaroa = A variant of Rexie with a black title page and black font on a light grey background
+ Fang = A version for use in dark rooms, with dark backgrounds and light fonts

Most credit (but no blame) should go to the author of: https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/146682, where the set up was adapted from.
